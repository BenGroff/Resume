# Resume
Check Out My Resume Website!

Construction is still underway as I work to finish up some of the final details on it and expand my portfolio a bit. Per the usual, any feedback regarding my code would be much appreciated!

What is it:
This is my Resume and Portfolio website built for inclusion on my resume to help me stand out. 

The goal was to create a responsive and ininteractive website to show off my resume, portfolio projects, give people a better idea about who I am, and make it so I can be contacted. 

This was also another build that I wanted to add to my GitHub so that I can expand the number of projects I can show off. This website was also built with the help of a Start Bootstrap template. It helped me to spend less time on some of the design aspects of the website, but I revamped most of the code in order to make it mine!
